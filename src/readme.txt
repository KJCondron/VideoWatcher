This Intel Media SDK tutorial source code package was downloaded from:
http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-media-sdk-tutorial

Please refer to the webpage for details on how to use the samples.

The tutorial sample code refers to a set of media files (YUV, H.264 streams and containers). None of the content referenced are provided as part of the tutorial.
But, such content can be acquired from many sources on the web. One example is Big Buck Bunny (http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/).
Oftentimes you need to extract the video elementary stream from a container such as "mp4" before using it as input to Intel Media SDK. Some
suggestions on how to do this are explained in the Intel Media SDK Developer Guide document (part of the Intel Media SDK package).
Raw YUV data (for input to Intel Media SDK encoder) can be generated using the tutorial decode samples or the Intel Media SDK decode sample.

The tutorial samples were developed and tested using Intel Media SDK 2012 R3 and Intel Media SDK 2013. For questions, or to report issues
with the tutorial samples presented in this article please use the Intel Media SDK Forum (http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-media-sdk).
