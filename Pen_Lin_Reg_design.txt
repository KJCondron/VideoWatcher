Each frame is a row, with up to 720*400*6 attributes and 1 target value
attribute size can be restricted by defining a specific set of pixels to act as a representative sample

1) define score board black section, as a very specific n*m range. n*m*6 attributes, target value 1 for scoreboard presesnt 0 for not present.
This is a good model for presenece / absence of scoreboard but not so good if we don't know where the score board is


2) Sample 1000 positions spaced equaly over the frame. 6000 attributes. 
	a) Target value = 1 score board present, 0 if not. Obv some positions are unrelated
	b) Each pixel is a row with just 6 attributes Target value is 1 if in area of interest, 0 if not.
		Quite hard to generate this data set, but this model should be good at determining pixels in the scoreboard


maybe compare 2 with variance of 6 attributes on top of model 1 to eliminate many frames with no scoreboard
