assuming cropY and cropX == 0

Y  = 
UV = U1V1U2V2U3V3U4V4U5V5U6V6U7V7U8V8U9V9


pixels labeled column, row

pixel (0,0) = y = Y(0),         U =UV(0), V = VUV(1)
pixel (1,0) = y = Y(1),         U =UV(0), V = VUV(1)
pixel (0,1) = y = Y(0+pitch),   U =UV(0), V = VUV(1)
pixel (1,1) = y = Y(1*pitch+1), U =UV(0), V = VUV(1)

pixel (m,n) = y = Y


i 0 to h / 2
j 0 to w

u value = UV + i * Pitch + j
v value = UV + i * Pitch + j + 1

i 0 to h
j = 0 (w chunks written at a time?)

y value = y + i * Pitch + j


2 choices 

a) is all 2x2 pixel black ie U = 0X80, V = 0x80 and 4 Y values = 0x00
b) is single pixel black Y value = 0x00 and U value for pixel = 0x80, v value for pixel = 0x80


decode reads each individual U and V value getting all 4 y values should be easy

code needs to be changed to read every Y value

if a single pixel is black, we can only change all color of 2x2 group because they share U and V, we could change just the brighness of that pixel

so a seems most logical

YYYYUV
